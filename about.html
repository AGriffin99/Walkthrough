       This story is a short text-based hero's journey with a choose your own adventure twist. I have chosen this concept, because I enjoy create your own adventures and love how one option can change the whole aspect of the story you are reading. The idea is that you are a mysterious hero sent to another land to go on a journey. It is easily assumed that this will be a typical hero's journey, but it is not. If anything it is like one of the books you read as a child, where one moment you can be in a spaceship and the next you are in a black hole then GAME OVER. I enjoy my concept, because it gives an unfamiliar take to a heroâ€™s journey, even though you have to go the path predestined for the hero, there is other options for an ending than the hero saving the day. I chose to make this a short story, more than a long adventure so the readers get a taste and see if they would like to do more of these types of stories, before committing to a longer story and process. The short layout also allows for me to add a few alternate endings, without having to produce a long interesting plot line that will entertain the reader for longer than a few minutes.
